# anno1800-retroactive-dlc-activation
Description of how to retroactively activate one or more Anno 1800 DLCs in a savegame.

# Steps
1. Get the latest release of RDA Explorer here: https://github.com/lysannschlegel/RDAExplorer/releases
   - Load the desired Anno 1800 save game into RDA Explorer (Save games are stored in `%userprofile%\Documents\Anno 1800\accounts`)
   - Export gamesetup.a7s to a local folder
2. Use a zlib library (e.g. Python zlib.decompress) to decompress `gamesetup.a7s` to ` gamesetup_zlib_decompressed`
3. Clone https://github.com/anno-mods/FileDBReader.git and open it in Visual Studio (the Community version is free).
    - Run FileDBReader with command line parameters in the working directory of ` gamesetup_zlib_decompressed`: `decompress -f gamesetup_zlib_decompressed`. You'll get a `gamesetup_zlib_decompressed.xml` as output.
4. Open the xml file and find the section `<ActiveDLCs>`. Add the desired DLCs to the list of DLCs and update the count accordingly.    
    Full list of DLCs as of Sept. 19th, 2022: ``` <ActiveDLCs>
      <count>0A00000000000000</count>
      <DLC>B8410600</DLC>
      <DLC>B9410600</DLC>
      <DLC>BA410600</DLC>
      <DLC>E3410600</DLC>
      <DLC>81610000</DLC>
      <DLC>CB410600</DLC>
      <DLC>D6410600</DLC>
      <DLC>D7410600</DLC>
      <DLC>E4410600</DLC>
      <DLC>E5410600</DLC>
      <DLC>82610000</DLC> <!--Reich der LÃ¼fte-->
    </ActiveDLCs>```
5. Compress the xml file using FileDBReader: `compress -f gamesetup_zlib_decompressed.xml -o fdbr -c 2`
6. Use a zlib library (e.g. Python zlib.compress) to compress `gamesetup_zlib_decompressed.fdbr` to `gamesetup.a7s`
7. Use a binary editor (e.g. [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/downloads/)) to open `gamesetup.a7s` and paste `x<bh:da><bh:03><bh:00><bh:00><bh:00><bh:00><bh:01><bh:f0>&<bh:00><bh:00>` at the very end of the file and save it.
8. Use RDA Explorer to import the new `gamesetup.a7s` into your save game and save the file.
9. Run Anno 1800 and load that explicit save game.
